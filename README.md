# telnet_server
Playing around with telnet. 
This is heavily outdated stuff. Do not use.

## telnet
As telnet is not anymore part of modern operating systems (thank god),
I created a minimal Dockerfile that let's me use telnet on CLI.
Create the docker image and run it by using this command:

```sh
./telnet_docker/run_telnet.sh HOST PORT
```
